Kalman_assignment_3

2-D motion of the car-  Apply kalman filter -/ green box - actual position of car -/ blue box -estimated position
Bonus - car driving in circle - current state model won't work well - because - build a new state model

Objective: 
- Learn to build state model for 2-D
- Understand the significance of P and R
- Bonus - Build state model with 5 states - angle of car - velcoity vector  - angular velocity added instaed of xdot and ydot

Without added error -  when turining or driving in circle - estimates is the worst

Changes in R are afffecting more than P

Normal Straight drive:

Increase P - better estimate
Increase R -  worse estimate - more overshoot while turning - hihger rise time - slow reaction

Circular drive:

R - decrease - estimate better - lower rise and settling time - very low overshoot
At low R  and when error added in P = 0.1, changes in P don't have much effect on estimate.
At high R and when error added in P = 0.1, increase in P -  better estimate - constant error - fast reaction - but still not good as high R estimate

Increase in added error - Increases overshoot and settling time

When you implement five states system:

X = [ x
      y
      v
      theta
      theta_dot]  where v is the velocity magnitude and theta is the angle of the car's heading
      
The state matrices will change acoordingly.
Result -  Improved estimated values - follows very closely - fast reaction
