# dedcution:
Assume a and b as weightages in  : self.v = self.v * a + measured_v * b
See if you have:
Case I:  a > b
        Then the velocity calculated reaches the actual value:
        Smoothly - longest steady state time
        Error is very low - Oscillations after steady state is low
        Longer time to reach the actual value
Case II:  a = b
        Then the velocity calculated reaches the actual value:
        Faster than before-steeper curve
        Error is low but not as the earlier one
        Realative shorter time to reach the actual value
Case III:  a < b
        Then the velocity calculated reaaches the actual value:
        Steeply - fastest - shortest steady state time
        Error is very high -  Oscillations after steady state is high
        Shortest time to reach the actual value
        
This is just line Kp, Kd and Ki.
